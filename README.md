# Pocket Network Contracts

Pocket Network is a blockchain agnostic, decentralized transaction relay network. Nodes in the network spend compute in the form of running local nodes (geth/parity, bitcoin core, zcash, etc) and hosting standardized REST API endpoints. Nodes relay transactions for users in return for mint in PKT.

Users must stake PKT in order to use Node services. User transactions are throttled based on the amount of PKT staked in the PocketToken contract. Users must stake more PKT to send more transactions.
